/**
 * Canonical project catalogue.
 *
 * File: src/lib/constants/demos.ts
 * Purpose: single source of truth for demo/repo cards.
 * Used by: project grid, filters, and tests.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - Titles: concise, sentence case, no trailing punctuation.
 * - Descriptions: 1–2 sentences, UK spelling, plain English.
 * - Links: always `repoLink`; add `demoLink` only if a live demo exists.
 * - `type`: "demo" | "repo" (nothing else).
 * - `importance`: "high" | "medium" | "low" | "lowest".
 *   Sorting/grouping depends on these exact strings.
 * - Order: keep stable; add new items at the end unless prominence is needed.
 *
 * @example
 * import { demoItems } from "@/lib/constants/demos";
 * const featured = demoItems.filter(i => i.importance === "high");
 *
 * @see DemoItem in "@/types"
