 * Predefined highlight icons representing key technical and professional skills.
 *
 * Each highlight includes:
 * - A human-readable title
 * - A short description
 * - An associated SVG icon component
 * - Tailwind CSS classes for text and background colours
 *
 * These icons are rendered in the `Highlights` component to display
 * a responsive grid of skill cards on the homepage.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The colour classes support both light and dark modes, using Tailwind's
 * `dark:` variants for dynamic theming.
