                <h2>My Journey in Learning Technology</h2>

                <p>
                    I have over a decade of experience in blended and digital
                    learning, combining pedagogical expertise with technical
                    development to improve learning experiences. Beginning as a
                    CELTA-qualified English teacher, I&apos;ve delivered over
                    10,000 lessons with consistently high ratings, and used my{" "}
                    <em>
                        Level 4 Preparing to Teach in the Lifelong Learning
                        Sector
                    </em>{" "}
                    (PTLLS) to design and deliver training in academic English
                    and study skills in both further and higher education.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I transitioned from teaching to learning technology through
                    a growing interest in programming, which began when I
                    automated tasks in VBA as a university administrator. While
                    teaching in Portugal, I deepened this interest through
                    self-study on platforms such as Khan Academy and
                    freeCodeCamp, applying what I learned to improve workflows
                    and enhance digital resources. As I took on new
                    responsibilities, I expanded my work with APIs and
                    automation, which led to a full-time development role and
                    confirmed my path into educational technology.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alongside this, I&apos;ve led the development of scalable
                    backend systems and optimised GraphQL APIs for a custom
                    Learning Management System (LMS) supporting over 700,000
                    learners. This dual perspective — both educational and
                    technical — enables me to design learner-centred solutions
                    grounded in pedagogical principles and responsive to
                    real-world needs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Throughout my career, I&apos;ve remained passionate about
                    using digital tools to enhance teaching and learning. As a
                    Virtual Onboarder, I trained new teachers in a custom LMS
                    via Microsoft Teams, supported by tailored sessions and
                    video training. I&apos;ve also created bespoke business
                    English courses for professionals, adapting content to
                    learner needs and industry contexts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My experience as a university administrator using Moodle and
                    SharePoint helped shape the design of an intuitive LMS for
                    international use. Drawing on my teaching background, I
                    refined features such as automated flashcards and
                    pronunciation feedback to support personalisation and
                    engagement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Accessibility is a key focus of my work. I&apos;ve created
                    content to support non-native speakers and neurodiverse
                    learners — including visual documentation, explainer videos,
                    and GIFs designed for clarity and retention. In a prior role
                    as Transformation Project Manager, I automated financial
                    workflows using Python and Pandas, and led Excel training to
                    promote data literacy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My professional development includes training in user story
                    writing, manual testing, Confluence, Jira, and several
                    programming languages. I aim to deliver user-centred,
                    accessible solutions grounded in good practice.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I currently work as a Learning Technologist within Imperial
                    College London&apos;s ICT division, a role for which I was
                    recruited due to my combination of technical expertise and
                    teaching experience. My work bridges pedagogy and
                    technology, supporting Imperial&apos;s strategic aim to
                    deliver innovative and inclusive digital education. I
                    collaborate with faculty-based learning technologists across
                    the Faculty of Natural Sciences, Engineering, Business
                    School, Medicine, and the Interdisciplinary EdTech Lab,
                    ensuring that our solutions are coherent, scalable, and
                    responsive to the needs of staff and students.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In practice, this involves co-designing learning experiences
                    with academics, administrators, and developers, applying
                    technical skills to LMS migration projects, writing user
                    stories, conducting manual testing, and gathering user
                    feedback to enhance digital learning. I also provide
                    guidance on effective technology-enhanced learning
                    practices, translate project requirements into technical
                    specifications, and recommend integrated solutions, ensuring
                    accessibility and inclusivity at every stage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This dual perspective — grounded in classroom teaching and
                    strengthened by technical development — enables me to act as
                    both a pedagogical partner and a technical specialist. I
                    contribute to communities of practice, share emerging
                    knowledge with colleagues, and help maintain consistent
                    standards across Imperial&apos;s diverse digital education
                    landscape.

                    I am submitting this portfolio for CMALT accreditation to
                    formally recognise my contributions to learning technology.
                    It marks a key step in my professional development,
                    reflecting my commitment to innovation and inclusion in
                    education. This portfolio demonstrates the depth and breadth
                    of my practice and affirms the influence of my work across
                    the sector.
