                <p>
                    You should show how you have used or supported others to use
                    technology appropriately, given the constraints and benefits
                    it provides within your context. You should consider how you
                    compared and contrasted the constraints and benefits of
                    different technologies to meet the specific needs of users
                    (students or staff).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Evidence in support of such statements might include a brief
                    commentary on the choices behind the development and use of
                    Learning Technology that influence its fitness for purpose.
                    This might discuss issues such as affordances of the
                    technology, viability, sustainability, scalability,
                    interoperability and value for money. Suitable evidence may
                    include a design outline, proposal, conference presentation
                    or similar. Alternatively, you might want to take this
                    opportunity to find out more about a technology you have
                    deployed, and produce a report on its viability, relating
                    this to the constraints and benefits of different
                    technologies.

                <h2>Description</h2>

                <p>
                    In my role as a Learning Technologist at Imperial College
                    London, I have been part of a cross-functional team
                    evaluating multiple LMS platforms (Blackboard Ultra,
                    Brightspace, Canvas) to support a major institutional
                    review. This required direct comparison of the platforms,
                    evaluating their APIs, integration models, accessibility
                    compliance (such as WCAG 2.1), and alignment with the
                    pedagogical and administrative needs of various faculties.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To assist with this, I developed a reusable Postman
                    collection for testing Blackboard Ultra&apos;s APIs and
                    authored detailed user stories to ensure the LMS evaluation
                    process was grounded in real-world requirements.
                    Additionally, I created structured manual test scripts to
                    explore functionality limitations and prepared for future
                    automation testing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alongside technical evaluation, I engaged with key
                    stakeholders to manage change effectively, recognising that
                    successful adoption depends on clear communication and
                    aligning technology capabilities with user readiness.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 2020/21, I faced a different set of constraints while
                    working at Learnlight, where I designed internal tools in
                    Python and Electron to streamline internal workflows, reduce
                    processing time, and improve data accuracy. One example was
                    a custom Electron desktop app that significantly reduced
                    report generation times and improved onboarding efficiency.
                    In choosing between web-based, desktop, and cloud solutions,
                    I had to carefully weigh up factors such as user access,
                    offline availability, speed, and internal infrastructure
                    limitations â€” all of which shaped the final design and
                    delivery method.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>

                <p>
                    Choosing between technologies is rarely straightforward, as
                    each comes with trade-offs. For example, Blackboard Ultra
                    offers deep API access and mature accessibility features,
                    but its user interface feels more traditional compared to
                    the cleaner, more modern UX design of Canvas and
                    Brightspace. While Canvas and Brightspace provide flexible,
                    cloud-native integration models and a more intuitive
                    experience for end users, they may lack some of the
                    institutional familiarity and long-standing accessibility
                    tooling that Blackboard offers. Through API testing and
                    hands-on exploration, I found that achieving scalability and
                    interoperability often involves compromises, such as reduced
                    customisation or the need for greater investment in staff
                    training and change management.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My approach to technology evaluation always considers the
                    wider ecosystem and the technology&apos;s fitness for
                    purpose, particularly how it will scale within complex
                    educational settings and remain maintainable over time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In my technical work, I&apos;ve found that automation with
                    tools like Electron or Python/Pandas can offer enormous time
                    savings, but also come with trade-offs in terms of long-term
                    maintainability and user onboarding. When developing an
                    Electron-based report automation tool, I weighed the
                    benefits of direct local file access against the constraint
                    of platform specificity. To address this, I configured the
                    Electron app to compile for both macOS and Windows using
                    platform-specific build tools, ensuring full cross-platform
                    compatibility with minimal disruption to existing workflows.
                    This cross-platform support was a key factor in choosing
                    Electron over a web-based solution.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I&apos;ve also become more attuned to issues like value for
                    money and sustainability. Open technologies and standards
                    (like REST/GraphQL APIs or WCAG/EN301549 accessibility
                    guidance) tend to offer greater interoperability but require
                    more internal capacity to use and sustain effectively.
