                <h2>Description</h2>

                <p>
                    In my career as both a developer and a learning
                    technologist, I have worked with a wide range of learning
                    technologies, including VLE platforms, accessibility tools,
                    and assessment environments. I have contributed to the
                    evaluation and optimisation of Learning Management Systems
                    (LMS) such as Blackboard Ultra, Canvas, Brightspace, and
                    Moodle by customising workflows, testing features, and
                    supporting academic staff in their use.
                </p>

                />

                <p>
                    I&apos;ve also developed bespoke tools using JavaScript,
                    Python, and Excel â€” from building GraphQL APIs within a
                    commercial LMS to creating desktop applications with
                    Electron for staff onboarding and training. These tools have
                    improved platform efficiency, enhanced staff engagement, and
                    often reduced technical barriers to adoption.

                <p>
                    Key tools and technologies I&apos;ve used in learning
                    contexts include:

                <p>
                    Much of my work has bridged technical development and
                    practical pedagogical application. At Learnlight, for
                    example,{" "}
                    <a
                        href={graphQlCertificate}
                        target="_blank"

                    >
                        I optimised GraphQL API responses
                    </a>{" "}
                    and implemented automated backend testing to support a
                    commercial LMS serving over 700,000 learners. While highly
                    technical, this work had a direct educational impact:
                    improved system performance translated to better student
                    experiences.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One project that exemplifies this balance was my integration
                    of the{" "}
                    <a
                        href={oxfordLearnersDictionariesApi}

                        rel="noopener noreferrer"

                        Oxford Learner&apos;s Dictionaries API Entry Fetcher
                    </a>{" "}
                    into the Learnlight platform. I developed a Node.js proof of
                    concept that fetched and reformatted dictionary entries into
                    accessible, semantically structured HTML. Using Cheerio for
                    parsing, I removed superfluous elements and applied
                    lightweight styling to match our platform&apos;s design.
                    This gave students reliable, accessible definitions without
                    interrupting the flow of lessons.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All features I developed were designed to work within the
                    Learnlight App, which was the primary interface used by
                    students to access their online lessons. The platform was
                    built for blended delivery, combining self-paced digital
                    content with synchronous teaching, so mobile performance,
                    accessibility, and seamless user experience were critical.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At Imperial College London, I brought this technical
                    foundation into a more learner-facing role. I wrote API
                    scripts based on LMS documentation (including Swagger
                    specifications) and{" "}
                    <a
                        href={blackboardPostmanCollection}
                        target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    >
                        used Postman to evaluate endpoints related to identity
                        and access management (IAM), data analytics, and system
                        configuration
                    </a>
                    . These scripts supported LMS evaluation by revealing system
                    behaviours and limitations across platforms.
                </p>

                <FigureWithCaption
                    src={ictAnalystTestScriptScreenshot}
                    alt="A screenshot of the test scripts"
                    caption="A screenshot of the test scripts"
                />

                <p>
                    Alongside this, I developed manual test scripts aligned with
                    real-world teaching needs, including navigation structures,
                    module aesthetics, bulk uploads, and user activity logs.
                    These enabled broader staff participation in the evaluation
                    process and informed my training delivery. For example, the
                    ICT Senior Analyst test script exemplifies how I worked
                    closely with academic and technical colleagues to understand
                    their specific needs. By collecting user stories from IAM
                    administrators and ICT Senior Analysts, I identified key API
                    functionalities for their workflows, such as documentation
                    accessibility, data request formats, and response
                    limitations. This collaborative approach ensured that the
                    testing scripts were directly relevant to real-world tasks.
                    This dual approach allowed me to explain platform
                    capabilities and constraints from both user and developer
                    perspectives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through these roles, I&apos;ve gained a deep appreciation
                    for scalable solutions, accessible design, and the practical
                    constraints institutions face when adopting or changing
                    systems. My work consistently aims to reduce technical
                    friction, build user confidence, and support learning
                    outcomes through thoughtful, hands-on use of technology.
