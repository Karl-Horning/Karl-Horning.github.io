                <h2>Future Directions in Learning Technology</h2>

                <p>
                    Looking ahead, I intend to further integrate the learning
                    technology and development aspects of my practice, with a
                    particular focus on accessibility, open standards, and
                    learner agency. My experience supporting the selection and
                    deployment of learning technologies at the institutional
                    level has reaffirmed my commitment to designing tools and
                    systems that are inclusive, evidence-informed, and sensitive
                    to diverse learning contexts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Over the next few years, I plan to deepen my engagement with
                    accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.2 and EN 301 549, and
                    to work more actively with user-centred design and
                    co-creation practices, ensuring that learners and educators
                    are directly involved in shaping the tools they use.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I&apos;m increasingly drawn to the intersection of pedagogy
                    and code, especially in projects involving LMS platforms,
                    open educational resources, and interactive front ends built
                    with technologies like React, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL. I
                    hope to contribute to open-source tools or standards in this
                    space, whether through code contributions or by developing
                    guidance to support collaboration between educators and
                    developers.

                        I also plan to continue writing about what I learn in
                        coding and accessibility through my blog
                    </Link>
                    , using it as a space to share practical examples,
                    reflective insights, and reusable solutions for the wider
                    learning technology community. As my technical work evolves,
                    I will keep refining my use of TypeScript — a language I
                    increasingly value for its ability to catch errors early and
                    promote clarity through strong typing. I also intend to
                    expand my use of automated accessibility testing frameworks
                    such as <code>@axe-core/playwright</code>, which I currently
                    use on{" "}

                    to identify and resolve accessibility issues during
                    development. This experience has shown how valuable
                    automated testing can be in catching issues early and
                    embedding accessibility as a core part of the development
                    process rather than an afterthought, and I plan to continue
                    applying it in future projects alongside manual testing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In future projects, I aim to deepen my data-informed
                    approach to accessibility evaluation, combining automated
                    testing with analytics on issue trends and resolution rates
                    to establish evidence-based accessibility benchmarks. I also
                    plan to continue developing my{" "}
                    <a
                        href={styleGuides}

                    repository, which consolidates documentation standards for
                    READMEs, CSS, comments, and Git commits. Building on this
                    foundation, I intend to expand it into a broader developer
                    education resource — creating accessible, maintainable
                    coding examples and guidance that support inclusive
                    engineering practices. This will allow me to unite my
                    background as an educator with my technical expertise,
                    helping others apply clarity, accessibility, and
                    sustainability principles in their own development work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alongside accessibility, I am increasingly interested in
                    ethical and sustainable design in educational technology —
                    exploring how performance optimisation, energy efficiency,
                    and inclusive development intersect in building equitable,
                    responsible systems for learning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Continuing professional development will remain a priority.
                    I plan to undertake further formal training in digital
                    accessibility and ethics in AI, and to stay actively engaged
                    with ALT and other professional networks that foster the
                    sharing of inclusive, evidence-based practice. I am also
                    considering CMALT Lead or Senior CMALT in the future,
                    particularly if I move into a role with strategic oversight
                    of learning technologies or staff development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally, I aim to mentor others entering the learning
                    technology and development professions, particularly those
                    from underrepresented or non-traditional backgrounds. Having
                    benefited from strong peer networks myself, I believe it is
                    important to give back by encouraging reflective,
                    learner-centred practice and by supporting others in
                    developing their own inclusive, sustainable approaches to
                    technology.
