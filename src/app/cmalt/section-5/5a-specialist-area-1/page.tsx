                    In describing your specialist area(s) you should refer to
                    the core values listed at the top of these guidelines.
                    Because these are specialist areas you should be clear what
                    makes your work distinct from common practice; many people
                    teach on online courses, but designing and delivering fully
                    online courses requires specific skills and would be
                    considered specialist. Similarly, many teachers provide
                    blended learning, but developing and sharing guidelines for
                    such practice or working with a distinctive blend of
                    contexts might distinguish your work as specialist. It may
                    be that your specialist area is common amongst the group
                    that you work in as you all work in a similar area; that is
                    perfectly acceptable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Evidence for your specialist activity is likely to be very
                    specific but could include: reports, papers or presentations
                    you have written; this could be backed up by a job
                    description plus written statements supporting your
                    specialist knowledge from colleagues, clients or managers;
                    active membership of professional or other bodies;
                    certificates of completion of specialist training programmes
                    or courses.

                    My specialist area is full-stack JavaScript development,
                    with a focus on building and optimising GraphQL APIs and
                    working with relational databases like PostgreSQL â€” skills
                    that go beyond basic web development. What makes this work
                    distinct isn&apos;t just the technical complexity, but how
                    I&apos;ve applied it within an educational context to
                    improve learner access, system performance, and platform
                    reliability.

                        I transitioned into development after more than a decade

                    , and that background has shaped how I build software. From
                    2021 to 2024, I worked as a full-stack JavaScript developer
                    at Learnlight, a global EdTech company serving over 700,000
                    learners. I built and maintained its learning platform, the
                    same one I previously used as an English language trainer.
                    In that role, I:

                    This work combined programming, systems thinking, and user
                    empathy to make sure that performance improvements aligned
                    with the real needs of our learners and staff. For example,
                    optimising backend calls wasn&apos;t just about efficiency:
                    it helped improve access in low-bandwidth regions and
                    reduced operational costs. Aligning technical systems with
                    educational outcomes is what drives my development work.

                <p>
                    My development work also includes testing, documentation,
                    and developer workflows. I&apos;ve introduced quality
                    assurance processes that directly impacted how quickly and
                    safely new features could be deployed, which is especially
                    critical in always-on learning environments. I&apos;m
                    comfortable working across the stack, utilising React and
                    Next.js on the front end, Node.js and PostgreSQL on the back
                    end, and collaborating with Agile teams using tools such as
                    Jira, Confluence, and Git.

                    Ultimately, my specialist skill set lies at the intersection
                    of education and engineering. I develop systems that are
                    technically sound, but always with the learner in mind. That
                    might mean better accessibility, faster load times, clearer
                    documentation for future contributors, or more stable APIs
                    to support global delivery. My background allows me to
                    navigate both pedagogical and technical challenges, and
                    that&apos;s where I can add the most value.

                    Transitioning from educator to developer has shaped not just
                    what I build, but how and why I build it. My background in
                    education taught me to think about systems in terms of
                    clarity, access, and inclusion â€” principles I now apply in
                    my development work. For instance, implementing performance
                    optimisations like reducing GraphQL query duplication with{" "}
                    <code>dataloader</code> wasn&apos;t only about technical
                    efficiency. It also improved access for users in
                    low-bandwidth regions and improved the trainer experience â€”
                    an often-overlooked group who benefit just as much from
                    responsive tools and reliable interfaces.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One challenge I&apos;ve consistently faced is the
                    inaccessibility of developer documentation. Concepts like
                    batching and caching in GraphQL are often explained in
                    overly abstract, text-heavy ways that don&apos;t cater to
                    diverse learning styles. As a visual learner, I often turned
                    to alternative resources such as video tutorials, MOOCs, and
                    community forums to fill the gaps. These experiences shaped
                    my approach to documentation: I now write detailed READMEs,
                    use JSDoc consistently, and document GraphQL schemas so
                    they&apos;re easily understood and usable in tools like
                    GraphQL Sandbox. I&apos;ve come to see documentation not
                    just as a technical requirement, but as a way to support
                    more inclusive learning and development.

                    Being self-taught has also meant navigating imposter
                    syndrome, especially in teams made up of traditionally
                    trained developers. Finding mentors with similar backgrounds
                    has been difficult, and at times I&apos;ve felt isolated.

                    explain concepts in a way that&apos;s approachable and

                    For me, development is not just a technical pursuit, but a
                    continuation of my commitment to lifelong learning and
                    learner empowerment â€” values I carry with me throughout my
                    time in education.

                    <li>
                        Applied full-stack JavaScript development skills â€”
                        including GraphQL, PostgreSQL, and Node.js â€” in an
                        educational context to improve learner access, system
                        performance, and reliability

                    <li>
                        Delivered specialist backend optimisations (for example,
                        using <code>dataloader</code> and API rate limiting) to
                        enhance platform efficiency and support learners in

                    <li>
                        Introduced quality assurance practices such as automated

                    <li>
                        Demonstrated cross-stack proficiency (React, Next.js,

                        Maintained a reflective development practice through
                        ongoing self-directed training and community engagement

                        Made technical systems more accessible through clear,
