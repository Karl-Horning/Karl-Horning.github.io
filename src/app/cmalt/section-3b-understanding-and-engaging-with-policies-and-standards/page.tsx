                <p>
                    In my work creating digital learning resources, I have
                    implemented GDPR-aligned practices, including:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Using anonymised screenshots or dummy data when
                        producing guides or training materials
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensuring personal data, such as student names or email
                        addresses, is not visible or shared, particularly when
                        supporting diverse, mixed cohorts
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Being careful to avoid including personally identifiable
                        information when demonstrating tools, particularly video
                        or screen recordings
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    In addition to removing personal data, I ensure that, where
                    possible, screenshots and recordings meet accessibility
                    expectations — such as clear contrast and readable text — in
                    line with WCAG 2.1.

            <section id="reflection">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>

                <p>
                    As with accessibility standards explored in Section 3a, I
                    see data protection not just as a compliance requirement,
                    but as a core element of ethical, inclusive learning design.
                    GDPR training has deepened my understanding of how easily
                    personal data can be exposed, particularly in visual media
                    like screenshots or screen recordings. This awareness has
                    shaped how I plan and deliver digital learning resources,
                    ensuring they are lawful, transparent, and
                    privacy-conscious.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My approach reflects Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR, which
                    outlines the principle of data minimisation:
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and limited to
                        what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
                        they are processed (data minimisation).
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    This principle is reinforced by{" "}

                    , which defines anonymisation as the removal of all
                    identifiers such that data can no longer be attributed to an
                    individual. It also highlights that pseudonymised data (such
                    as coded identifiers) may still be considered personal data
                    under the law.
                </p>

                <FigureWithCaption

                />

                <p>
                    As a result, I have embedded data protection principles into
                    my daily workflow. I default to using anonymised or dummy
                    data — even under tight deadlines — and check file names and
                    visible content before sharing learning materials. I
                    maintain a reference list of tools like{" "}

                    for generating safe-to-use content. When using live systems
                    for demonstrations, I set up test accounts to ensure no
                    personally identifiable information is shown.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These principles also guide my communication practices. For
                    example, I take care when emailing student groups to avoid
                    disclosing personal email addresses without consent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over time, I have developed a proactive and pragmatic
                    approach to safeguarding data in digital education. I
                    routinely anonymise content, review materials for privacy
                    risks, delete any student data that is no longer required,
                    and ensure that my communications reflect data protection
                    principles and are in line with data retention policies. I
                    have also shared these practices through informal guidance
                    and staff training.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rather than seeing GDPR as a constraint, I view it as an
                    essential professional standard that supports ethical,
                    inclusive, and legally compliant digital learning
                    environments. My approach reflects both institutional
                    policies and broader sector expectations around the
                    responsible use of learner data, such as those outlined by
                    the Information Commissioner&apos;s Office (ICO) .
