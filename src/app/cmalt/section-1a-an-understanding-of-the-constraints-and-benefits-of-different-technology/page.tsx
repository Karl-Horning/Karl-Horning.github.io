                <p>
                    In my role as a Learning Technologist at Imperial College
                    London, I have been part of a cross-functional team
                    evaluating multiple LMS platforms (Blackboard Ultra,
                    Brightspace, Canvas) to support a major institutional
                    review.{" "}

                        This required direct comparison of the platforms
                    </a>
                    , evaluating their APIs, integration models, accessibility
                    compliance (such as WCAG 2.1), and alignment with the
                    pedagogical and administrative needs of various faculties.
                </p>

                <FigureWithCaption
                    src={colourAccessibilityUserStories}
                    alt="A screenshot of two of the colour accessibility user stories"
                    caption="A screenshot of two of the colour accessibility user stories"
                />

                <p>
                    Accessibility was a consistent priority across all
                    faculties, but the Faculty of Natural Sciences and the
                    Faculty of Medicine raised specific requirements around
                    colour schemes and visual accessibility. To capture these
                    needs, they developed detailed user stories with acceptance
                    criteria. For example, requirements included configurable
                    background colours, high-contrast modes, and support for
                    colour-blind users through preset colour schemes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We then had to decide which elements should be provided
                    natively within the LMS and which could be supported through
                    external tools such as <em>ColourVeil</em>. To justify this,
                    we compared the degree to which each platform could natively
                    preserve accessibility when colour schemes were customised.
                    For instance, one LMS automatically adjusted text colour (to
                    black or white) depending on the selected background,
                    ensuring contrast ratios always remained accessible. This
                    feature was judged particularly valuable as it reduced the
                    reliance on external tools and prevented user error.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To ensure claims about accessibility could be validated,
                    testers used <em>Accessibility Insights</em> to check that
                    colour customisations met WCAG standards. Links to this
                    testing resource were included directly in the evaluation
                    scripts, making the process transparent and reproducible.
                </p>

                <FigureWithCaption

                    caption="A screenshot of the colour scheme test"
                />

                <p>
                    Alongside technical evaluation, I engaged with key
                    stakeholders to manage change effectively, recognising that
                    successful adoption depends on clear communication and
                    aligning technology capabilities with user readiness.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To support the evaluation process more broadly, I developed
                    a reusable{" "}

                    and authored detailed user stories to ensure the LMS
                    evaluation process was grounded in real-world requirements.
                    Additionally, I created structured manual test scripts to
                    explore functionality limitations and prepared for future
                    automation testing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through API testing and hands-on exploration, I found that
                    achieving scalability and interoperability often involves
                    compromises, such as reduced customisation or the need for
                    greater investment in staff training and change management.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My approach to technology evaluation always considers the
                    wider ecosystem and the technology&apos;s fitness for
                    purpose, particularly how it will scale within complex
                    educational settings and remain maintainable over time.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>

                <p>
                    My experience comparing these platforms highlighted that
                    choosing between technologies is rarely straightforward, as
                    each comes with trade-offs. For example, Blackboard Ultra
                    offers deep API access and mature accessibility features,
                    but its user interface feels more traditional compared to
                    the cleaner, more modern UX design of Canvas and
                    Brightspace. While Canvas and Brightspace provide flexible,
                    cloud-native integration models and a more intuitive
                    experience for end users, they may lack some of the
                    institutional familiarity and long-standing accessibility
                    tooling that Blackboard offers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The accessibility case study around colour customisation
                    highlighted how we dealt with multiple requirements by:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        capturing them in structured user stories and acceptance
                        criteria,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        testing them using consistent methods and tools, and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        justifying choices by balancing native functionality
                        against reliance on external tools.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    In my technical work, I&apos;ve found that automation with
                    tools like Electron or Python/Pandas can offer enormous time
                    savings, but also come with trade-offs in terms of long-term
                    maintainability and user onboarding. This experience gave me
                    confidence in evaluating trade-offs systematically, and I
                    now approach new technology choices with a clearer sense of
                    how to balance staff needs with long-term sustainability.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On review, these experiences have had a lasting impact on
                    how I approach learning technology. I have become more
                    confident in championing accessibility earlier in technology
                    reviews, and in using structured methods like user stories
                    and acceptance criteria to manage stakeholder needs. This
                    has also shaped how I communicate with staff: I now place
                    greater emphasis on showing how technical decisions (such as
                    native vs external colour accessibility) directly affect
                    teaching and learning, ensuring that staff understand both
                    the benefits and the limitations of a platform.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For students, these evaluations make a tangible difference —
                    for example, ensuring that colour customisation works
                    natively in the LMS reduces barriers to engagement and
                    supports inclusive teaching. Overall, I feel my practice has
                    become more systematic, evidence-based, and confident as a
                    result of my work on the Digital Education Platform Project
                    (DEPP).
                </p>

                <p>
                    For staff, this process also provided reassurance that
                    accessibility was prioritised from the outset, which
                    strengthened trust in the evaluation and reduced the risk of
                    accessibility being treated as an afterthought. Working with
                    multiple faculties showed me that even when requirements
                    differ, structured user stories provide a shared language.
                    Overall, these experiences have made me more confident in
                    leading evaluations where technical, pedagogical, and
                    accessibility requirements must be balanced, and in
                    articulating how those decisions directly affect both
                    teaching and learning.
