                <h2>Description</h2>

                <h3>International Context</h3>

                <p>
                    Between 2014 and 2024, I worked as a freelance English
                    teacher while living in Portugal. During this period, I
                    offered private lessons to adult learners, primarily across
                    Portugal, Spain, Italy, France, and Germany. Because I was
                    based outside the UK and most of my students were located
                    within the EU, I focused more closely on European
                    legislation and guidelines.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This experience significantly shaped my awareness of data
                    protection requirements under the{" "}
                    <a

                    , which applies across the EU and was directly relevant to
                    the handling of learner data. It also made me more attuned
                    to digital accessibility requirements at the European level,
                    especially EN 301 549. I ensured that materials provided to
                    learners complied with accessibility expectations across
                    borders, particularly regarding video captions, document
                    design, and platform usability.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These early experiences informed my later work in the UK
                    context, where I now combine an understanding of European
                    standards with UK-specific guidance such as the{" "}

                <h2>Reflection</h2>

                <p>
                    Manually creating accurate subtitle files was a rewarding
                    yet time-consuming process. I learnt that subtitle timing
                    must align closely with the speaker&apos;s voice and
                    on-screen events to avoid distraction. Early attempts
                    involved considerable trial and error, but the final
                    products met WCAG 2.1 standards and offered an inclusive
                    experience for all users.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The impact on learners, particularly non-native English
                    speakers, was notable. For example, in the absence of
                    visible speakers (no lip-reading cues), subtitles enabled
                    learners to better follow digital learning platform
                    demonstrations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Over time, I came to understand that providing both
                    subtitles and a full transcript offers a more inclusive
                    experience, catering to diverse learner preferences and
                    needs. Transcripts enable learners to skim or search content
                    quickly and are particularly helpful for those who prefer or
                    require a text-based alternative.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In terms of document accessibility, I saw improvements in
                    learner engagement and fewer questions about where to find
                    key information. Structuring documents properly made them
                    more navigable, especially for screen reader users. My
                    evolving understanding of EN 301 549 and WCAG 2.1 helped me
                    go beyond compliance and take a proactive role in inclusive
                    content design.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Looking back, I recognise that these practices are not only
                    about meeting regulatory standards but also about ethical
                    commitments. Respecting learner privacy under GDPR reflects
                    a wider duty of care in handling sensitive information.
                    Similarly, prioritising accessibility goes beyond compliance
                    with WCAG or EN 301 549: it is about ensuring learners&apos;
                    rights to participate fully and equitably. By providing
                    subtitles, transcripts, and accessible documents, I aim to
                    reduce barriers and support learner autonomy, acknowledging
                    the moral responsibility I have as an educator and
                    technologist, both in international and UK contexts, to
                    create inclusive and respectful learning environments.
