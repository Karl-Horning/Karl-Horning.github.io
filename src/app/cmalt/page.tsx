/**
 * Renders the **CMALT Portfolio Home Page**.
 *
 * This page introduces the user's CMALT accreditation portfolio,
 * explaining its structure, purpose, and navigation. It serves as
 * the main landing page for the CMALT section of the site.
 *
 * ### Layout structure
 * - {@link PageIntroSplit} — Hero section with title, description, and CTAs.
 * - {@link CmaltSidebar} — Persistent sidebar for section navigation.
 * - `<main>` — Core content explaining the portfolio and framework.
 * - {@link PrevNextButtons} — Pagination links for previous/next sections.
 * - {@link ContactCta} — Footer call-to-action inviting further contact.
 *
 * ### Behaviour
 * - Fetches adjacent section data via {@link getPrevNextCmalt} for
 *   contextual pagination between CMALT pages.
 * - Uses locally sourced metadata from the `meta` module for title and slug.
 * - The primary CTA links to the next CMALT page, falling back to the index route.
 * - The sidebar remains sticky on large screens for easy navigation.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This page contains the introductory overview and explanation of the
 * CMALT framework. It is designed for clarity and accessibility rather
 * than dynamic interactivity.
 *
 * @async
 * @returns The statically rendered CMALT home page layout.

 * @example
