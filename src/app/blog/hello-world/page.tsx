                Welcome to my blog! I&apos;m calling this the &quot;first
                post&quot;, but really, it&apos;s a placeholder â€” something to
                test layouts and that lovely moment when a blank site becomes
                something more than a skeleton.
            </p>

            <p>That said, I thought I&apos;d make it useful.</p>

            <p>
                This site is my digital notebook, portfolio, and playground.
                Expect a mix of topics â€” from thoughts on learning technology
                and software development, to accessibility, to side projects
                that may or may not get finished (but are fun to build anyway).
            </p>

            <p>
                I&apos;m building the blog with{" "}
                <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank">
                    Eleventy (11ty)
                </a>
                , a lightweight static site generator. It&apos;s fast, flexible,
                and â€” once you get the hang of it â€” satisfying to work with.
                I&apos;ve paired it with Tailwind CSS to keep things clean and
                responsive.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you&apos;ve stumbled across this while everything&apos;s
                still under construction, thanks for your patience! And if
                you&apos;re here on purpose: welcome. I hope you find something
                interesting!
            </p>
